Above in C. is the wheel of fortune mainly in gold with the usual four figures. It is inscribed: (top) Glorior elatus. (R.) Descendo minorificatus. (bottom) Infimus axe teror. (L.) rursus ad astra feror. Below two stately crowned females in patterned robes, and light pink mantles, gold-bordered. The one on L. Fortuna is turning the wheel. She has a scroll: Mundana casu aguntur omnia. The other Sapientia points one finger up: her scroll is: Nichil in mundo fit casu. Round the frame on three sides is: Ego sapientia habito in consilio et eruditis intersum cogitationibus, per me reges regnant etc. to inuenient me (Prov. viii. 12-17). The style is severe and impressive"
