In the lower margin a shield surmounted with crest and surrounded by the garter with motto. Shield and crest have been carefully erased and so has a banner in the R. margin The picture, rather rubbed, but in fine Flemish style, represents the interior of a room with wooden roof. On L. stone fire-place with fire. On R. bed in alcove: green tiled floor. Before the fire lies a nude infant. The mother, in tall headdress, sits wringing her hands on seat (along the wall). Two maids kneel on L. in consternation. In C. the Seigneur de Gaures in gown with stick, gesticulating. Two men and two women on R. in consternation Along the back wall is a settle ending on R. in a kind of desk. The wall is hung with an arras, deep red ground, gold birds in pairs, two rows of trees, on each a scroll bearing one word of the garter motto. The incident shown is the Seigneur de Gaures throwing his infant son into the fire (see f. 8r)"
