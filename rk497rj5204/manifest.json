  "description": "This cutting from a German Missal, CCCC MS 638, was given to Corpus Christi College by Dr Robert Lefever in 2007. It is the Te igitur initial, the opening of the Canon of the Mass, and comes from a Missal made in the third quarter of the fifteenth century, probably in Swabia. The iconography is of female personifications of Ecclesia and Synagoga, with the brazen serpent, a typological symbol of the Crucifixion, wound around the initial T. The pelican piercing her breast, another type of the Crucifixion and special emblem of Corpus Christi College, is in the upper decorative border. The arms on this page are of the von Magenbuch family, and other cuttings from the same Missal with the same arms are in collections in Philadelphia and Tokyo."
